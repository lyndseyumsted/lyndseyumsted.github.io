							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hi there! Originally from San Diego, California I grew up 
							enjoying the sunny weather, beautiful beaches, and an 
							outdoor lifestyle. When I made the move four hours north to 
							attend the University of California, Santa Barbara, I quickly 
							realized that the vibrant coastal community and its ideal
							setting made it feel like a second home to me. As I approach 
							the completion of my academic journey at UC Santa Barbara, I 
							am gearing up to graduate this December with a Bachelor of 
							Science in Statistics and Data Science, complemented by a 
							minor in Anthropology. These last three years have been marked 
							by unprecedented challenges, such as the onset of 
							the Covid-19 pandemic during my first year, and navigating 
							the transition between virtual learning and 
							in-person engagement. Despite such adversity, 
							I remain optimistic and driven to continue my growth 
							and development within the realm of Data Science.</p>
						<p>My interests and applications are varied as I have taken 
							time to dive into different areas of data science. My 
							application of data analysis, machine learning, and even 
							OpenAI integration have spanned the areas of environmental 
							science, public health, spatial data science, and HR 
							systems. Each experience has afforded me invaluable 
							opportunities for learning and skill development, and 
							I'm enthusiastic about sharing detailed insights into the 
							processes, outcomes, and expertise I've gained below. 
							Enjoy!</p>

							<h2>Work Experience</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The following are relevant work experiences and internships where I have utilized and developed my data science skills both in the areas of statistical modeling and data analysis.</p>
						<hr>
							<li>
								<h3>Earth Research Institute</h3>
								<h5>Undergraduate Research Intern</h5>
									<p>Between June, 2022 and September, 2022, I completed 
										a ten-week project working as an undergraduate 
										research assistant for the MacDonald Lab. I 
										leveraged machine learning and statistical modeling 
										to predict the effect of anthropogenic land use on 
										leishmaniasis dynamics – a project sponsored by the 
										National Science Foundation (NSF) in partnership 
										with UC Santa Barbara’s Earth Research Institute. 
										This project not only advanced my research and 
										statistical modeling knowledge, but also furthered 
										my collaboration and communication skills. </p>
									<p>The project consisted of exploring the impact of 
										several variables on the risk of cutaneous 
										leishmaniasis in different municiplatiies in 
										Brazil, Columbia, and Peru. I assisted in designing 
										several classification models using both land-use 
										and climate indicators. The land-use indicators 
										included light pollution levels, and deforestation 
										rates over time. The climate indicators included 
										precipitation levels, standing water levels, and 
										temperature over time. The main goals of the project 
										were to build an accurate classification model to 
										predict each municipality's risk for high rates of 
										cutaneous leishmaniasis, and to also identify the 
										top drivers for high rates of the disease.</p>
									<p>By the end of the internship, my partner, Terrell 
										Sipin, and I identified a stacked classication 
										model as the best performing with an accuracy metric 
										of 85% and an Area Under the Reciever Characteristic 
										Curve (AUROC) of 0.9. Our ensemble included the 
										following base models: Generalized Linear Models, 
										XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and 
										Naive Bayes. We also identified light pollution, and 
										population to be the most important variables for 
										classifying each municiplaity's disease risk. These 
										are land use variables, however deforestation 
										indicators failed to achieve higher performance 
										than other abiotic climate infdicators such as 
										precipitation and standing water occurance.</p>

								<h3>New Relic</h3>
								<h5>Data Analyst Intern</h5>
									<p>Between May, 2023 and August, 2023 I completed a 
										ten-week internship with New Relic as a Data 
										Analyst Intern on the People Analytics Team. 
										During this position, I executed a comprehensive 
										end-to-end data pipeline, utilizing data from 
										various sources such as public APIs and internal 
										HR systems to evaluate the Diversity, Equity, and 
										Inclusion (DEI) landscape across New Relic’s global 
										and cross-functional workforce. With this 
										information I designed a dynamic dashboard in 
										Looker Studio, enabling end users to gauge DEI 
										health in the areas of race, ethnicity, and gender. 
										My work was presented to the DEI team and senior 
										leadership, delivering a comprehensive analysis and 
										key areas of opportunities for New Relic.</p>
									<p>This role strenghtened my data analysis and 
										engineering skills in a multi-level corporate 
										setting. I was also given the oportunity to truly 
										develop my public speaking and presentation skills 
										when presenting the final pipeline and dashboard to 
										several internal teams and leadership. Working with 
										demographic data at such a granular level was new 
										and exciting, and working alongside the Diversity, 
										Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) team let me explore an 
										application of data analysis to a topic I carry deep 
										passion for.</p>
									<p>I apapted a tutorial on how to benchmark a hypothetical 
										company's DEI initiatives and this tutorial project can 
										be found on my <a href="https://github.com/lyndseyumsted/Data_Analyst_Internship_Project">Github</a>.

								<h3>Predicting Covid-19 Risk in California Communities</h3>
								<h5><a href = "images/Building a Predictive Model on Covid-19 Risk.pdf">Read Final Report Here</a></h5>
									<p>Between October and December of 2022, I had the 
										opportunity to complete an individual machine 
										learning project as a part of my Machine Learning 
										course (PSTAT 131). With inspiration from the 
										project I completed just prior on disease risk 
										for cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Amazon, I 
										pursued a similar topic but with Covid-19 in 
										California. I was provided data from faculty 
										Dr. Andrew MacDonald who was my PI in the 
										undergraduate research assistant position. 
										The first goal of this project was to build and 
										deploy machine learning models which could 
										accurately predict California zip codes into low, 
										moderate, or high risk for Covid-19. Secondly I 
										wanted to answer the questions of what factors in 
										a population have underlying effects on the number 
										of Covid-19 Cases, what kinds of populations are 
										at higher risk for Covid-19 outbreaks, is there 
										evidence of socioeconomic correlation with higher 
										Covid-19 rates, and is there evidence of pollution 
										level effects on Covid-19 rates?</p>
									<p>I explored each of these goals and questions in order 
										to grasp a better understanding of the data and 
										dynamics behind Covid-19 rates in California in 
										the year 2020. I trained nine machine learning models 
										including: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic 
										Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes Classifier, K 
										Nearest Neighbors, Single Classification Decision 
										Tree, Bootstrap Aggregated Decision Tree, Random 
										Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosted Tree, and 
										Elastic-Net Regression. Each of the models were 
										trained using k-fold cross validation and their 
										performance was compared using their accuracy 
										scores and Area Under the Receiver Operating 
										Characteristic (AUROC) Curve. The model that 
										performed the best on the testing set was the 
										Bootstrap Aggregated Decision Tree (Bagged Tree) 
										with an accuracy of 0.71 and an AUROC of 0.9. 
										Using this model I then explored the most important 
										variables and performed some post-exploratory 
										analysis.</p>
									<p>Through exploratory data analysis I found that there 
										is a large correlation between socioeconomic factors 
										such as poorer education, high poverty rate, low 
										median family income, and linguistic isolation and 
										high risk for Covid-19 outbreaks. These relationships 
										point to how communities struggling with more 
										socioeconomic problems are at a disproportionate 
										risk for Covid-19 outbreaks. As a result of this 
										project, I would consider the Covid-19 pandemic a 
										public health concern as well as a socioeconomic 
										concern. The entire project repository as well as 
										a more in depth report can be found on my 
										<a href="https://github.com/lyndseyumsted/Predicting-Covid-19-Risk-with-Machine-Learning/tree/main">Github</a>.</p>

								<h3>Understanding and Modeling Human Mobility Response to California Wildfires</h3>
								<h5><a href = "images/Understanding and Modeling Human Mobility Reponse to California Wildfires.pdf">Read Paper Here</a></h5>
									<p>During my third year of my undergaduate, I was accepted 
										into UC Santa Barbara's year long Data Science Capstone. 
										Beginning in January of 2023 I joined three other capstone 
										members as a project group for the Movement Data Science 
										Lab on campus run by Associate Professor of Spatial Data 
										Science, Somayeh Dodge, in the Department of Geography. 
										The MOVE Lab Data Science Capstone Project was centered 
										around exploring and modeling human mobility responses 
										to California wildfires. Our project and methods used 
										human movement data at each place of interest (POI) 
										surrounding specific wildfires, and in particular, this 
										case study focused primarily on the Lake Fire from Los 
										Angeles County in 2020.</p>
									<p>This project is a case study
										in using self-supervised learning to address the challenge of quantifying 
										human movement patterns in cases of natural disaster. We
										leveraged smartphone tracking data from multiple sources on activity
										at several Places of Interest (POIs) surrounding wildfire locations
										to understand the human mobility response to the Lake Fire in Los
										Angeles County in 2020. Spatiotemporal clustering was used to group
										POIs based on activity over time and geography, and subsequently we
										applied binary segmentation on aggregated activity data to infer the
										impactedness of each cluster. We then trained a classification model to
										predict whether a location is impacted by the fire based on location
										attributes, proximity, and direction. </p>
										<p>As a part of our work, we demonstrated the
											superiority of this clustering-based approach over for anomaly
											detection on a location-by-location basis. Our final logistic regression model had an accuracy of 0.75 and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) Curve of 0.80. The predictions from
											the model allow us to understand what areas are at most risk for
											an influx or outflux of human activity during wildfire events, and
											using our preferred method we identified higher risk of impact (i)
											near the fire, (ii) in the direction of burn, and (iii) at location types
											expected to be sensitive to human mobility response.</p>
										<p>We note that the COVID-19 pandemic substantially complicates
											inference of impactedness; our method does not distinguish impact
											due to the fire from impact due to COVID-19. The confounding of
											these two events in our case study likely diminishes the predictive
											performance of our model.</p>
										<p>This research could be extended by augmenting the training data
											to span multiple fires and incorporating additional geographical
											features (e.g., wind direction, elevation, air quality, etc.). A more
											robust model trained on data from multiple fires could potentially
											be used to generate spatial contours of impact risk based on fire
											attributes and geography alone; such an extension of our work has
											the potential to support assessment and estimation of wildfire risk
											on movement flows in Californian communities, which could in
											turn improve disaster response planning.</p>
										<p>This project was submitted and accepted by the KDD 2023 
											Southern California Data Science Day as a part of the ACM 
											KDD Conference in Long Beach, California in August of 2023.
										The <a href = "images/move_poster_abstract (1).pdf">pdf abstract</a> 
										can be found here to learn more details about the project methods and 
										results.</p>

											partially supported with a fellowship from NSF under Award No.

								<h3>Forecasting the United States' Unemployment Rate in the Absence of the Covid-19 Pandemic</h3>
								<h5><a href = "images/Forecasting the US Unemployment Rate.pdf">Read Paper Here</a></h5>
									<p>In one of my final courses taken at UC Santa Barbara, Time Series Analysis,
										I had the opportunity to complete an individual time series project
										on a topic and data set of my choosing. I decided upon the unemployment 
										rate, a measure which is highly impacted by economic recessions and other 
										events. Thus, I was curious to investigate the impact of the Covid-19 
										Pandemic on the unemployment rate, and predict what this rate would
										have been if this event were not to have occured. </p>
									<p>The purpose of this time series project is to forecast the United States’ unemployment rate into the
										years 2020 through 2023 using data from 2010 through 2018 with 2019 as validation. The main
										questions addressed in this analysis are: how do the predicted unemployment levels from January of
										2020 to the present differ from the observations seen with the Covid-19 Pandemic? Are the
										unemployment rates in the past three to four years much higher than what a predictive model would
										forecast?</p>
									<p>Bhe purpose of this time series project is to forecast the United States’ unemployment rate into the
										years 2020 through 2023 using data from 2010 through 2018 with 2019 as validation. The main
										questions addressed in this analysis are: how do the predicted unemployment levels from January of
										2020 to the present differ from the observations seen with the Covid-19 Pandemic? Are the
										unemployment rates in the past three to four years much higher than what a predictive model would
										forecast?</p>
									<p>Using the fitted model, I was able to validate the model’s ability to forecast into the year 2019. I then
										observed and compared the model’s predicted values with the actual time series of the United State’s
										unemployment rate through October of 2023. I found that not only do current unemployment rates lie
										above the forecast 95% confidence interval, but they are also two times higher than the predicted
										unemployment rate, meaning twice as many Americans are out of work than what the SARIMA model
										forecasts in the absence of the Covid-19 Pandemic.</p>	
									<p>Forecasting unemployment rates is important to measure future economic stability. Being able to
										compare predictions to observations when an anomalous event happens allows us to measure the
										impact significance to prepare for future events.</p>
